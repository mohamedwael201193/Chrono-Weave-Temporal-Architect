## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom temporal animations
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Blockchain**: Monad Testnet integration
- **Authentication**: Monad Games ID (Privy Global wallet)

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Temporal Architecture
Design and optimize complex energy networks across multiple quantum dimensions. Each placement affects not just the current loop, but creates ripple effects through time that influence future iterations.

### Quantum Mechanics
Harness quantum entanglement to create instant connections across vast distances. Balance energy consumption with strategic advantage as you build increasingly sophisticated temporal networks.

### Time Loop System
- **Energy Sources**: Generate temporal and quantum energy
- **Conduits**: Basic, Quantum, and Temporal conduits with different efficiencies
- **Targets**: Energy destinations that must be reached for scoring
- **Temporal Residue**: Past actions leave traces that affect future loops

### Scoring System
- **Efficiency**: Energy transfer optimization
- **Time Loops**: Number of completed temporal cycles
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Bonus for complex network connections
- **Temporal Echoes**: Learn from previous player strategies

## 🔗 Monad Games ID Integration

### Features
- **Cross-Game Identity**: One username across all Monad games
- **Verifiable Scores**: All achievements recorded on-chain
- **Transparent Leaderboards**: Immutable ranking system
- **Community Challenges**: Share level seeds and compete
